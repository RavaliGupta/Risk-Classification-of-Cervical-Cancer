# Risk-Classification-of-Cervical-Cancer

Recently there has been a lot of research going on in the area of Cervical cancer detection and treatment. Doctors are working to learn more about cervical cancer, ways to prevent it, how to best treat it, and how to provide the best care to women diagnosed with this disease. Many data driven approaches are emerging to diagnose this type of tumor. This study not only predicts whether a person has risk of developing cancer but also helps in identifying the major risk factors that leads to cervical cancer. The data set is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/loveall/cervical-cancer-risk-classification/data).
